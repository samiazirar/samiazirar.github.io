## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the Robotics Perception and Learning Lab at the University of Bonn. During my PhD I want to answer the question, how we can train robots from in the wild human videos and where the limits of this offline learning are! For this I want to train Video Generation Models as Wold simulator. Moreover, I want to enbale scaling across enviroments, tasks and also embodiments, to enable cross embodiment geenralizatio.

## Research Interests

- **World Models:** Video generation, physical plausibility, temporal coherence  
- **Robotics:** Trajectory learning, cross-embodiment transfer, generalization
