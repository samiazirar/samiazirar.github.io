## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the Robotics Perception and Learning Lab at the University of Bonn. During my PhD, I aim to answer the question of how we can train robots using web videos. For this, I want to use video generation models as world simulators. I aim to enable generalization in robotics by scaling across enviroments, tasks, and embodiments!

I am also associated with [LAMARR](https://lamarr-institute.org). 

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:sazirar@uni-bonn.de) for collaborations
