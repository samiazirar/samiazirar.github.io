## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the Robotics Perception and Learning Lab at the University of Bonn. During my PhD I want to answer the question, how we can train robots from in the wild human videos and where the limits of this offline learning are! For this I want to train Video Generation Models as Wold simulator. Moreover, I want to enbale scaling across enviroments, tasks and also embodiments, to enable cross embodiment geenralizatio.

## Research Interests

- **World Models:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning

## News

- **[Feb. 2020]** Our paper about incremental learning is accepted to CVPR 2020.
- **[Feb. 2025]** I started as a PhD Student at the RPL Lab Uni Bonn!
- **[Feb. 2024]** I started my Master Thesis about Task Planning at the RWTH RLeap in Aachen.
